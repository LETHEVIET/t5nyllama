## Lightweight English Text Editing Assistant (t5nyllama)

This repository houses the source code for t5nyllama, a lightweight English text editing assistant designed to provide a simple and efficient way to enhance your writing.

**How it Works:**

t5nyllama uses a two-step approach:

1. **Text Generation:** The core of the assistant is a TinyLlama model, specifically fine-tuned for text editing. This model is designed to improve the flow and clarity of your text, making it more polished and engaging. However, TinyLlama is **relatively small and not particularly adept at complex grammar correction.**

2. **Grammar Correction:** To address this limitation, we employ a powerful Flan-T5 model for a second pass. This model takes the output of the TinyLlama model and carefully analyzes it for grammatical errors. It then suggests corrections, ensuring your final text is grammatically sound and ready for publication.

**Key Features:**

- **Lightweight and Efficient:** The TinyLlama model is quantized to 4-bit precision, minimizing memory usage and computational demands, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.
- **Focused on Text Improvement:** TinyLlama excels at refining the overall quality of your writing, making it more readable and engaging.
- **Enhanced Grammar Accuracy:** The Flan-T5 model provides a robust final check for grammatical errors, ensuring your text is free from mistakes.

**Design Principles:**

- **Local Application:** Prioritizes offline functionality, allowing you to edit text without requiring an internet connection.
- **Lightweight Design:** Minimizes resource consumption, making the application suitable for a wide range of devices and systems.
